# School_District_Analysis #

# **Overview** #

For this project, Data Scientist Maria has asked for help with the analysis of a school district's standardized test scores. Student scores for math and reading were analyzed by school, school type (District or Charter), school size, and the budget for each school and spending per student. We are looking to see what affects, if any, that these variables have on test scores. This in turn will allow the School Board the opportunity to better budget for each school for each year.

During collection of the data, Maria was advised by the school board that there is an error. The 9th grade student scores were either falsified or fabricated and she must remove these. 
We then look to see what affect, if any, that removing these scores from the data set will do.
